# Anime and Manga List

As someone who watches anime every week, I have started a lot of animes. Some of them I have finished while others i have not. I created this anime and manga (for those of you who enjoy reading mangas) list in order to make it easier to keep track of which animes I have seen, which animes I have finished, and which animes that I enjoyed. The app will fulfill all these functions by providing an index of animes/mangas where you can add them to your own personal list, rating the anime/manga on your personal list out of 5 stars, marking whether you have finished the anime/manga, and having the ability to write a comment for the anime/manga.

Users are able to sign up and login/logout. After logging in users are able to leave comments and add animes/mangas to their own personal list. Users are also able to rate the animes on their list out of 5 stars as well as mark whether they have finished the anime/manga.

Technologies include Ruby on Rails backend, PostgreSQL database, React.js frontend, AniList API, graphQL database

## Installation

```bash
npm install
```

## Usage

```bash
npm run dev
```

You'll need to have the backend code https://github.com/dhxzhou/anime-list-api running on http://localhost:3000.
You can view the app on http://localhost:5173.

## Roadmap

In the future I plan to finished some of the above functions such as commenting, rating, and marking watched. Other ideas that I want to implement to the app is having a random button that will show users a random anime/manga on click.
